        <h6 class ="subtitle-head text-lightorange">Background Information</h6>
        <p class ="para" style = "line-height:2em;">
                This system is based on  online livestock trading and aims to enable farmers sell or 
                buy their livestock at the comfort of their homes maximizing on the profits by cutting off the 
                middlemen as well as widening the market base. The Idea was conceived during Covid-19 era when physical livestock markets across the East Africa were closed and there were no online markets for livestock trading in the region
                and farmers were stranded on where to sell or buy livestock.</p>
        <h6 class ="subtitle-head text-lightorange">How it works</h6> 
        <p class ="para" style = "line-height:2em;">   
                Farmers will be able to upload their livestock details then buyers bid on 
                the livestock just like it is in the real livestock markets. The bidding period is predetermined and will be automatically added. The buyer who bids highest will be 
                buyers of the livestock when bidding period expires. The buyer and the seller will agree on the means of the transport and 
                cost. On the same platform, buyers will be able to view the details of the livestock dealer/seller. 
                For a farmer to be able to upload livestock on the platform, they first will be required to sign 
                up on the platform and acquire an account. By providing their information,<i class = "text-lightorange"> which will ONLY be used to allocate space
                in the system</i>, users will be able to use that space to store their livestock data. Any 
                farmer/dealer without an account will not be able to transact on the platform other than viewing.
